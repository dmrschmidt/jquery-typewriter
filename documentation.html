    <h2>jQuery typewriter documentation</h2>
    <h3>installing it</h3>
    <p>
      To start using <i>jQuery typewriter</i> simply
      <a href="https://github.com/metzeltiger/jquery-typewriter">download</a>,
      unzip it and put the following code into your &lt;head&gt; tag.<br />
<pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="./js/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="./js/jquery.class.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="./js/typewriter.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
    </p>
    <h3>running it</h3>
    <p>
      After you did that, all you need to do is take any element you want to
      use the typewriter with and add the <i>class="typewriter"</i> to it.
      <p>That's it? Yes... That's it!</p>
    </p>
    <h3>mastering it</h3>
    <p>
      Now that you installed it and have your first <i>jQuery typewriter</i>
      up and runnung, you probably want to know how you can customize it to
      your liking. And guess what, there are quite a few possibilities for
      that.
    </p>
    <h4>general info</h4>
    <p>
      By default, the whole content of all
      <pre>class="typewriter"</pre>
      elements will be written in a typewriter way. However, if you don't want
      all elements to behave the same or even want elements that don't get
      animated at all, the only thing you need to do, is to provide these
      elements with
      <pre>class="typewrite"</pre>
      If there is at least one element as a child of your typewriter with
      this class, then only these elements will be animated.
    </p>
    <p>
      All configuration is done using custom HTML5 data attributes. Just add
      these to any element you want to manipulate and there's no need to touch
      any line of JS. Sweet, innit?
    </p>
    <h4>controlling the start</h4>
    <p>
      By default all typewriter text will be instantly written out after the
      page has completed loading. If you <i>don't</i> want this for a any
      typewriter, simply add the attribute
      <pre>data-autostart="false"</pre>
      to your typewriter element. It will then be excluded from the list of
      automatically started typewriters and you have to start it manually.<br />
      You can use any (clickable) DOM element to start the animation by
      simply adding
      <pre>class="typewriter-starter" data-start-typewriter="TYPEWRITER_ID"</pre>
      to the element you want to use. Just replace <i>TYPEWRITER_ID</i> with
      the actual ID of the typewriter you want to control. It will then be
      started when the user clicks on that element you specified.
    </p>
    <h4>letting it cycle</h4>
    <p>
      You'll notice, that by default each typewriter does some random
      "letter-cycling" animations before actually printing a letter and
      continuing on to the next one.<br />
      Firstly, you can control how many letters shall be cycled before the
      actual letter is printed. Do this by setting a value for
      <pre>data-iterations="20"</pre>
      You can also completely disable this cycling, by adding to the element
      <pre>data-cycling="false"</pre>
    </p>
    <h4>controlling the speed</h4>
    <p>
      Is the typewriter writing too fast or too slow for you? No worries. The
      delay between printing each letter can be customized by setting the
      attribute a time value in ms (mili seconds) like so
      <pre>data-timeout-letter="15"</pre>
      And if you want to put some emphasize on a certain part, you can also
      add a custom pause to that element, that is held before printing it.
      Simply specify the following attribute for that, again, with a time
      value in ms
      <pre>data-prepause="1000"</pre>
    </p>
    <h4>let it load</h4>
    <p>
      Maybe you want to pretend something is currently loading in the
      background. And of course, there's help for you. Simply specify
      <pre>data-prefill="true"</pre>
      and let the text show a loading animation before printing the actual
      text. This loading is indicated by dots being written at the place where
      the text will appear afterwards.<br />
      You can also control the time to wait between each dot, by simply
      setting a value (in ms) for
      <pre>data-timeout-wait="100"</pre>
    </p>
